      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>The common name "hellebore" is first attested in 1300s; it originates, via Old French and Latin, ultimately from Ancient Greek: ἑλλέβορος, romanized: helléboros. Although traditionally translated as "plant eaten by fawns", this could be folk etymology and, according to Beekes, really a Pre-Greek word.[6] It is not related to the word "hell", despite the toxic nature of this plant.

        In Anglo-Saxon England, the Anglo-Latin word elleborus had varied meanings. Around 900 AD, it was linked with "tunsingwyrt" (various spellings; likely an allium such as wild garlic) in the Old English Herbarium. Ælfric of Eynsham seemed to assert that elleborus had no vernacular Old English translation; by the early 11th century, "wodewistle" was used to gloss the word, possibly referring to hemlock or similar. These shifts reflect the developing understanding of Latin plant names in Old English texts.</p>

    <section id="description">
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The flowers have five petal-like sepals surrounding a ring of small, cup-like nectaries which are actually petals modified to hold nectar. The sepals do not fall as petals would, but remain on the plant, sometimes for many months. The persistence of the sepals may contribute to the development of the seeds.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="taxonomy">
      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>The genus was established by Carl Linnaeus in volume one of his Species Plantarum in 1753.[1]

        The scientific name Helleborus could derive from the Ancient Greek word ἑλλέβορος (helléboros), the common name for H. orientalis, constructed from ἑλεῖν (heleîn, "to injure") and βορά (borá), "food.".[9][10][11] It is also possibly from Greek, ἄλκη “fawn”, βιβρώσκω (bibrṓskō, “to eat”).</p>

      <section id="taxonomy-hybrids">
        <h3>Hellebore hybrids / Interspecific hybrids</h3>
        <p>Hybridising (deliberate and accidental) between H. orientalis and several other closely related species and subspecies has vastly improved the colour-range of the flowers, which now extends from slate grey, near-black, deep purple and plum, through rich red and pinks to yellow, white and green. The outer surface of the sepals is often green-tinged, and as the flower ages it usually becomes greener inside and out; individual flowers often remain on the plant for a month or more. The inner surface of each sepal may be marked with veins, or dotted or blotched with pink, red or purple. "Picotee" flowers, whose pale-coloured sepals have narrow margins of a darker colour, are much sought-after, as are those with dark nectaries which contrast with the outer sepals.

            Recent breeding programmes have also created double-flowered and anemone-centred plants. Ironically, doing this is actually reversing the evolutionary process in which hellebores' true petals had been modified into nectaries; it is usually these nectaries which become the extra petals in double, semi-double and anemone-centred flowers. Double-flowered hellebores[17] provide a very interesting variation to the standard hellebore. They are generally easy to maintain and share the same planting conditions as the standard hellebore.
            
            Semi-double flowers have one or two extra rows of petals; doubles have more. Their inner petals are generally very like the outer ones in colour and patterning. They are often of a similar length and shape, though they may be slightly shorter and narrower, and some are attractively waved or ruffled. By contrast, anemone-centred flowers have, cupped within the five normal outer petals, a ring of much shorter, more curved extra petals (sometimes trumpet-shaped, intermediate in appearance between petals and nectaries), which may be a different colour from the outer petals. These short, extra petals (sometimes known as "petaloids") drop off after the flower has been pollinated, leaving an apparently single flower, whereas doubles and semi-doubles tend to retain their extra petals after pollination.

    <section id="distribution">
      <h2>Distribution</h2>
      <p>Various species of this genus originated in Europe and Asia.[25] The greatest concentration of species occurs in the Balkans. One atypical species (H. thibetanus) comes from western China; another atypical species (H. vesicarius) inhabits a small area on the border between Turkey and Syria.</p>

            <h4>Phytomyza hellebori (Hellebore Leaf Miner)</h4>
            <p>
              More commonly known as the Hellebore leaf miner, Phytomyza hellebori is a small fly that infests only the H. foetidus plants in the Hellebore genus. The fly digs tunnels into the leaves, creating brownish-black blotches. These become nesting grounds for egg-laying. Larvae feed inside the leaves from late summer through early spring, disfiguring the foliage by spring.
            </p>
            <p>
              To control infestations, remove and destroy infected leaves during winter. Insecticides may help but can harm beneficial insects if applied during flowering.

            <p>
              Also known as greenfly, this aphid forms dense colonies and feeds on the sap of hellebores. They produce honeydew, which encourages sooty mold growth. Most active during March and April.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aphids begin feeding on leaves, then progress toward flower petals and young stems. Populations may consume entire plants if uncontrolled.
            </p>
            <p>

      <h2>Horticulture</h2>
      <p>Hellebores are widely grown in United States Department of Agriculture hardiness zones 5a to 8b gardens for decorative purposes. They are particularly valued by gardeners for their winter and early spring flowering period; the plants are surprisingly frost-resistant and many are evergreen.[34] Also of value is their shade tolerance.[4] Many species of hellebore have green or greenish-purple flowers and are of limited garden value, although Corsican hellebore (H. argutifolius), a robust plant with pale green, cup-shaped flowers and attractive leathery foliage, is widely grown. So is the 'stinking hellebore' or setterwort (H. foetidus), which has drooping clusters of small, pale green, bell-shaped flowers, often edged with maroon, which contrasts with its dark evergreen foliage. H. foetidus 'Wester Flisk', with red-flushed flowers and flower stalks, is becoming popular,[as of?] as are more recent selections with golden-yellow foliage.[citation needed]

        The so-called Christmas rose (H. niger), a traditional cottage garden favourite, bears its pure white flowers (which often age to pink) in the depths of winter; large-flowered cultivars are available, as are pink-flowered and double-flowered selections.
        
        The most popular hellebores for garden use are H. orientalis and its colourful hybrids, H. × hybridus (Lenten rose). In the northern hemisphere, they flower in early spring, around the period of Lent, and are often known as Lenten hellebores, oriental hellebores, or Lenten roses. They are excellent for bringing early colour to shady herbaceous borders and areas between deciduous shrubs and under trees.</p>

    <section id="toxicity">
      <h2>Toxicity</h2>
      <p>All helleborus plants are toxic, and all parts of the helleborus plant are toxic.[9][35] Hellebore poisoning is rare, but it does occur.[9]

        Hellebore plants are usually left alone by animals such as deer and rabbits because the leaves of the plant produce various toxins, making them distasteful to animals. The leaves have been known to sometimes bother gardeners with sensitive skin.[36] It was used in the First Sacred War at the start of the sixth century BC to poison the water supply of the city of Kirrha.
        
        Poisonings occur through ingestion or handling. Hellebore plants should not be ingested as poisoning cases are most severe when the plants are eaten. This is especially true when hellebores are eaten in large quantities.[35] Symptoms of ingestion include: burning of the mouth and throat, salivation, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nervous symptoms, and possibly depression. Consuming large quantities of hellebore plants can be fatal.[35] Toxic steroids occur in the roots. High levels of ranunculin and protoanemonin, especially in the leaves and sap, also contribute to symptoms after ingestion.[9]
        
        Dermatitis may also occur from handling the hellebore plants without protection. This is typically caused by the ranunculin and protoanemonin found on the outside of the plant, including the leaves, stem, flower, and sap. The poison on the outside of the plant causes irritation and burning sensations on the skin.[9][35] When collecting seeds from hellebore plants, it is recommended to wait for the pods to dry and shake them out into a container or onto the ground to collect. Attempts to remove the seeds by hand could potentially cause chemical burns. Small or minimal exposure to the toxins should only cause a mild irritation to the skin, and the affliction should only last for a few minutes. If the burning persists or intensifies, it is recommended to wash the affected areas thoroughly to remove the toxins and see a doctor.[9][35]
        
        The species historically known as "black hellebore" (Helleborus niger) causes tinnitus, vertigo, stupor, thirst, anaphylaxis, emesis (vomiting), catharsis, bradycardia (slowing of the heart rate), and finally, collapse and death from cardiac arrest.[37] Although black hellebore contains protoanemonin[38] or ranunculin,[39] which has an acrid taste and can cause burning of the eyes, mouth, and throat, oral ulceration, gastroenteritis, and hematemesis,[40] research in the 1970s showed that the roots of H. niger do not contain the cardiotoxic steroids helleborin, hellebrin, and helleborein that are responsible for the lethal reputation of "black hellebore". It seems that earlier studies may have used a commercial preparation containing a mixture of material from other species such as Helleborus viridis, green hellebore.[39]</p>

    <section id="uses">
      <h2>Uses</h2>
      <p>In the early days of medicine, two kinds of hellebore were recognized: black hellebore, which included various species of Helleborus, and white hellebore, now known as Veratrum album,[37] which belongs to a different plant family, the Melanthiaceae.[41] Although the latter plant contains highly toxic, teratogenic alkaloids such as veratrine, cyclopamine, and jervine, it is believed to be the "hellebore" used by Hippocrates as a purgative.[citation needed]

        Despite serious risks, "black hellebore" was used by the Greeks and Romans to treat paralysis, gout and psychosis.[42]

    <section id="culture">
      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p>H. niger is commonly called the Christmas rose, due to an old legend that it sprouted in the snow from the tears of a young girl who had no gift to give the Christ Child in Bethlehem.[43]

        In Greek mythology, Melampus of Pylos used hellebore to save the daughters of the king of Argos from a madness, induced by Dionysus, that caused them to run naked through the city, crying, weeping, and screaming.[44]
        
        During the Siege of Kirrha in 585 BC, hellebore was reportedly used by the Greek besiegers to poison the city's water supply. The defenders were subsequently so weakened by diarrhea that they were unable to defend the city from assault.[45]
        
        In a fit of madness induced by Hera, Heracles killed his children. His madness was cured using hellebore.[46]</p>
