        <p>
          Universal Design is a concept developed in the 1990s by architect and designer Ronald Mace, along with a team of innovators committed to creating environments and products usable by everyone, regardless of age, ability, or circumstance. Although Universal Design began in architecture and physical spaces, its principles translate seamlessly into modern digital design: the goal is the same—build experiences that everyone can access without needing special modifications.

        <h2 id="principles-heading">Principles</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> Designs should work for all users without separating or excluding anyone. In digital spaces, this means practices like providing alt text, ensuring high color contrast, and avoiding interactions that depend solely on a mouse.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> Interfaces should accommodate different preferences and abilities. This includes allowing text resizing, supporting multiple input methods, and avoiding forced or restrictive behaviors such as scroll hijacking.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use:</strong> Users should be able to understand and use an interface without confusion. Clear structure, predictable navigation, and familiar patterns help ensure that interactions feel straightforward and aligned with user expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> Information should be communicated clearly to users with varied sensory abilities. Organized text, helpful graphics, labels, and offering information in multiple formats all help make content understandable.</li>
          <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> Designs should minimize the chance of mistakes and reduce the consequences when they happen. Features like undo options, confirmation prompts, and forgiving forms protect users from irreversible errors.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> Interactions should require minimal physical and cognitive strain. Streamlined workflows, grouped actions, and reduced unnecessary steps help users complete tasks comfortably and efficiently.</li>
          <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</strong> Interfaces must accommodate different body sizes, postures, devices, and input methods. This includes designing large, reachable touch targets, allowing space for virtual keyboards, and ensuring layouts adapt well across screen sizes.</li>
