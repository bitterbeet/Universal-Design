        <h2 id="why-heading">Why Universal Design?</h2>
        <p>
          Universal Design is essential because people use digital technology with a wide range of abilities, needs, and conditions—many of which shift over time or change depending on the situation. Disabilities are not a fixed category: some people are born with impairments, others acquire them through aging, illness, or accidents, and many experience temporary or situational limitations like glare, noise, fatigue, or injuries. People may also live with multiple conditions that affect how they focus, navigate, or physically interact with digital tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Users also bring different devices, levels of tech familiarity, personal preferences, and expectations to their digital experiences. A layout that works perfectly on a large monitor may be difficult on a phone; an interface that feels intuitive to one person may confuse someone else. Even everyday factors—like being rushed, distracted, or multitasking—shape how people move through a website or app. Universal Design anticipates this full spectrum, creating experiences that are more flexible, resilient, and usable for everyone.

      <!-- Arguments Section -->
      <section id="arguments-section">
        <h2 id="arguments-heading">Top arguments to bring to your team</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Disability is not an edge case.</strong> Every user will experience some form of limitation—permanent, temporary, or situational. Designing for these needs improves the experience for all users.</li>
          <li><strong>Better for business.</strong> Accessible, universally designed products reach more people, reduce support requests, improve conversions, and increase customer satisfaction.</li>
          <li><strong>More inclusive, more equitable.</strong> When digital experiences are built for diverse abilities and contexts, they avoid excluding users.</li>
          <li><strong>Future-friendly and adaptable.</strong> Universal Design creates flexible structures that work across devices, environments, and emerging technologies.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhances overall usability.</strong> Clearer navigation, simpler interactions, and adaptable layouts benefit everyone—not only users with disabilities.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Stories Section -->
      <section id="stories-section">
        <h2 id="stories-heading">From grassroots to standards</h2>
        <p>
          Universal Design often begins at the grassroots level—with individuals, students, advocates, and creators who recognize gaps and push for better practices. These early efforts build awareness, shift attitudes, and demonstrate the value of designing for a wide range of human experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, what starts as grassroots advocacy becomes an expectation. As more people demand accessible, flexible, people-centered digital spaces, Universal Design moves from a “nice-to-have” to a standard practice. It becomes integrated into design systems, development workflows, organizational policies, and shared professional values. Standards like WCAG reinforce this shift, but the real momentum comes from creators who consistently choose to build a web that welcomes everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
          Universal Design grows into a standard when teams adopt it not out of obligation, but because they recognize it as the best—and most ethical—way to design.
